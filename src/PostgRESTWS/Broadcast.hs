{-| PostgRESTWS functions to broadcast messages to several listening clients
    This module provides a type called Multiplexer.
    The multiplexer contains a map of channels and a producer thread.

    This module avoids any database implementation details, it is used by HasqlBroadcast where
    the database logic is combined.
